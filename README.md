# What is Celebrity Dead or Alive?
Celebrity Dead or Alive is a fun game you can play anywhere to help pass time for free. The goal of our game is to see if you know who is actually dead or alive. We have 90+ different celebrities from all fields of work from musicians, to Hollywood, broadcast and athletes. The goal of the game is to correctly guess if said celebrity is alive or not. When you guess correctly, you get 1 (one) point. If you guess incorrectly, you receive 0 (zero) points.

When you first come to our game, you're greeted with a play now button. After you press the "Play Now" button, a celebrity card will slide in and you need to guess if he/she is alive or dead. You can play as a user that's not logged in if you choose, but you can only answer 5 (five) questions. After the 5 (five) questions you'll be prompted to "See How You Did", after you click that you can see your score. You can then "Create an Account" to keep your score and continue adding to it OR "Play Again" and your previous score will be thrown away and start over.
